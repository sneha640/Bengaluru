   The Nageshvara temple complex (also spelt Nagesvara and called Naganatheshvara locally) is located in Begur, a small town within the Bangalore urban district of Karnataka state, India. From inscriptions, it is known that Begur was once called Veppur, and Kelele (in Western Ganga King Durvinita's Mollahalli grant inscription of 580-625 C.E.). Two shrines within the temple complex, the Nageshvara and Nageshvarasvami were commissioned during the rule of Western Ganga Dynasty Kings Nitimarga I (also called Ereganga Neetimarga, r. 843-870) and Ereyappa Nitimarga II (also called Ereganga Neetimarga II, r. 907-921). The remaining shrines are considered a later day legacy of the rule of the Chola Dynasty over the region.
